Hi Everyone!

I'm thrilled to announce that I'm starting my open source contribution journey with **Apertre 3.0**! 

## What is Apertre 3.0?

Apertre is an open source program that brings together developers, mentors, and organizations to build impactful projects while learning and growing together. This year's edition (3.0) promises to be bigger and better with:

- 🎯 **Real-world open source projects** to contribute to
- 👥 **Mentorship** from experienced developers
- 🎁 **Swags** for active contributors
- 💰 **Rewards worth ₹50K+** for outstanding contributions
- 🤝 **Community** of like-minded developers

## Why Open Source?

Open source has always fascinated me. It's where developers from around the world collaborate to build tools that millions use. Contributing to open source means:

1. **Learning in public**: Getting real code reviews and feedback
2. **Building a portfolio**: Showing actual contributions to real projects
3. **Networking**: Connecting with developers globally
4. **Giving back**: Contributing to tools I use daily

## My Goals for Apertre 3.0

I'm approaching this program with clear objectives:

### Technical Goals
- Make meaningful contributions to at least 3 projects
- Learn new technologies through hands-on contributions
- Improve my code review and collaboration skills
- Master Git workflows for team collaboration

### Personal Goals
- Build relationships with other contributors
- Get comfortable with the open source contribution process
- Document my learnings through blog posts
- Finish the program with flying colors 🎯

## The Journey Begins
