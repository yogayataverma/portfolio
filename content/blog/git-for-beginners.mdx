Hey, internet!

Most developers use Git daily, but if you're just starting out, it can feel overwhelming. This guide breaks down Git into digestible chunks - core concepts, essential commands, and a workflow you can start using today.

## Core Terms You Need to Know

### Repository (Repo)
A folder that Git tracks. It contains your project files and a hidden `.git` folder where Git stores all version history.

### Staging Area
Think of it as a "preview" of your next commit. You add changes here before committing them permanently.

### Commit
A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique ID and a message describing what changed.

### Branches
Separate lines of development. The default branch is usually called `main` or `master`.

### HEAD
A pointer to the current branch/commit you're working on. It's basically "you are here" on the Git timeline.

## Essential Commands

### 1. Initialize a Repository

```bash
git init
```

Creates a new Git repository in your current folder. This adds the `.git` directory.

### 2. Check Status

```bash
git status
```

Shows which files are modified, staged, or untracked. Use this constantly - it's your Git compass.

### 3. Stage Changes

```bash
# Stage a specific file
git add filename.txt

# Stage all changes
git add .
```

Moves changes to the staging area, preparing them for commit.

### 4. Commit Changes

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

Saves staged changes permanently with a descriptive message.

**Pro tip**: Write clear commit messages! "Fixed bug" is vague. "Fixed login button not responding on mobile" is better.

### 5. View History

```bash
# See commit history
git log

# Compact view
git log --oneline
```

Shows all commits with their IDs, authors, dates, and messages.

### 6. See What Changed

```bash
# Changes in working directory (not staged)
git diff

# Changes in staging area
git diff --staged
```

Shows exactly which lines were added, removed, or modified.

## Safety Tools

### Reset: Undo Commits

Git reset has three modes:

#### Soft Reset
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
Undoes the last commit but keeps changes staged. Use when you want to recommit with a better message.

#### Mixed Reset (default)
```bash
git reset HEAD~1
# or
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
```
Undoes the last commit and unstages changes, but keeps them in your working directory.

#### Hard Reset
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
**⚠️ DANGER**: Completely removes the last commit and all changes. Use with caution!

### Stash: Temporary Storage

```bash
# Save current changes temporarily
git stash

# List stashed changes
git stash list

# Restore most recent stash
git stash pop

# Restore specific stash
git stash apply stash@{0}
```

Perfect for when you need to switch tasks but aren't ready to commit.

## A Simple Git Workflow

Here's a step-by-step workflow you can follow on any project:

### 1. Start Your Day
```bash
# Check current status
git status

# See what branch you're on
git branch
```

### 2. Make Changes
Edit your files normally in your code editor.

### 3. Review Changes
```bash
# See what you changed
git diff

# Check status
git status
```

### 4. Stage Changes
```bash
# Stage specific files
git add file1.js file2.css

# Or stage everything
git add .
```

### 5. Commit
```bash
git commit -m "Add user authentication feature"
```

### 6. Repeat
Continue this cycle: change → review → stage → commit.

## Practice Exercise

Try this on your computer right now:

```bash
# 1. Create a practice folder
mkdir git-practice
cd git-practice

# 2. Initialize Git
git init

# 3. Create a file
echo "Hello Git" > readme.txt

# 4. Check status
git status

# 5. Stage the file
git add readme.txt

# 6. Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# 7. Make a change
echo "Learning Git!" >> readme.txt

# 8. See the difference
git diff

# 9. Stage and commit again
git add readme.txt
git commit -m "Add learning note"

# 10. View history
git log --oneline
```

Congratulations! You just created your first Git repository and made commits.

## Key Takeaways

1. **git status** is your friend - use it constantly
2. Stage with **git add**, commit with **git commit**
3. **git diff** shows what changed
4. **git log** shows history
5. Use **git stash** when you need to save work temporarily
6. Be careful with **git reset --hard** - it deletes changes permanently

## What's Next?

Once you're comfortable with these basics, explore:
- Branching and merging
- Remote repositories (GitHub, GitLab)
- Collaboration workflows
- Git hooks and automation

Git seems complex at first, but these core commands cover 90% of daily usage. Practice them until they become muscle memory.
