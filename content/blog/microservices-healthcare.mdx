Healthcare systems demand reliability, security, and precision. When I joined the **Pegasus** project, we were tasked with digitizing the entire workflow of clinical sample collection, storage, tracking, and report dispatch.

## Why Microservices?

The complexity of healthcare workflows made microservices the obvious choice:

- **Isolation**: Each service handles a specific domain (samples, buildings, reports)
- **Scalability**: Individual services can scale based on demand
- **Maintainability**: Teams can work independently on different services
- **Resilience**: Failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system

## Sample-to-Building Allocation Service

One of my key contributions was developing a dedicated microservice for accurate sample-to-building allocation. This service needed to:

1. Track sample locations in real-time
2. Optimize allocation based on building capacity
3. Handle edge cases (urgent samples, special storage requirements)
4. Provide audit trails for compliance

## Observability: The Unsung Hero

In a distributed system, **you can't fix what you can't see**. We implemented comprehensive logging and activity tracking across all services. This wasn't just about debugging - it was about understanding system behavior and catching issues before they became problems.

### Logging Strategy

- Structured logging with correlation IDs across services
- Centralized log aggregation
- Real-time alerting for critical events
- Performance metrics for every endpoint

## Performance Optimizations

We applied several service-level optimizations:

- **Caching**: Frequently accessed data cached at the service level
- **Database connection pooling**: Reduced connection overhead
- **Batch processing**: Grouped operations where possible
- **Asynchronous operations**: Non-blocking I/O for better throughput

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with observability**: You need visibility from day one
2. **Service boundaries matter**: Poorly defined boundaries lead to tight coupling
3. **Test failure scenarios**: Things will fail; plan for it
4. **Documentation is critical**: In a distributed system, good docs save hours of debugging

Microservices aren't a silver bullet, but for complex domains like healthcare, they provide the flexibility and reliability needed to build systems that people depend on.
